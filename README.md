# Week 2 project

# Password validator script

This password validator will check password strength with the following requirements:
  * Length – minimum of 10 characters.
  * Contain both alphabet and number.
  * Include both the small and capital case letters.
  
The script will inform the user with green text if the password passed, and with red if didn't and all with messages explaining why. 

The script will return exit code 0 if it passed the validation and exit code 1 if it didn’t.

# UPCOMING FEATURE
* Optional: you can run the script with -f and the file location to read password from file
